# Electronics Product Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Project Description

This is a Machine Learning-based Electronics Product Recommendation System that suggests the best electronic products to users based on their preferences, historical data, and product features. The system uses algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods to provide personalized product recommendations.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests products based on user preferences and behavior.
- **Product Filtering**: Filters products based on categories, brands, price range, and other features.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes data from other users with similar interests.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends products based on features such as specifications and description.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
- **User Interface**: Web-based or console interface (depending on your implementation).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning libraries:
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - TensorFlow (if deep learning is involved)
- Data Storage: CSV/SQLite/NoSQL (depending on your dataset)
- Frameworks (for Web UI): Flask/Django (if applicable)
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib/Seaborn (for analysis and insights)
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD pipeline, optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/electronics-product-recommendation.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd electronics-product-recommendation
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
    ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. If you're working with a web interface, you can start the server:
    ```bash
    python app.py  # or 'flask run' depending on the setup
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this recommendation system is based on electronics product details, including:

- Product name
- Product description
- Features (e.g., screen size, processor type, battery life)
- User ratings and reviews
- Purchase history (if available)

You can either use publicly available datasets like the [Amazon Product Review Dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/) or collect your own dataset.

## Usage

1. **Input the user preferences** (can be manually set or automatically collected based on user behavior).
2. The system will process the data using the chosen ML algorithms.
3. The system returns a list of recommended products with descriptions, ratings, and pricing.
4. **(Optional)** Web-based UI where users can input their preferences and view recommendations.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Use collaborative filtering methods like k-NN or matrix factorization.
   - Use content-based filtering by comparing product descriptions and features.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to ensure the system's effectiveness.

4. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Generate a list of recommendations by combining collaborative and content-based filtering (hybrid approach).

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from recommendation_system import recommend_products

# Sample user preferences
user_preferences = {
    'category': 'Laptop',
    'brand': 'Dell',
    'budget': 800
}

# Get recommendations
recommendations = recommend_products(user_preferences)
for product in recommendations:
    print(f"Product: {product['name']}, Price: {product['price']}")
